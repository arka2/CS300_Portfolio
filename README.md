# CS 300 Projects

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Project One was answering the question of what data structure, out of a vector, hash table, and a binary search tree, would be the most efficient in terms of runtime and memory. Project Two read a CSV of college courses and stored each course in a data structure. The user can also search for a particular course by its number and can print out all the courses in alphanumeric order.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

In previous weeks, I wrote pseudocode to read a CSV and store the data in various data structures. I then took the pseudocode and calculated the runtime for each data structure, since each structure will store the course data slightly differently. For Project Two, I took the same pseudocode as my jumping off point for the program. I also referenced our textbook and previous assignments to help me.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

My biggest roadblock was not having a clear understanding of how to calculate a function's runtime. Before starting the runtime analysis, I reread our textbook, read articles, and read Stack Overflow questions. This gave me enough of an understanding to start Project One.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

These projects gave me a better understanding of how different data structures can be used. Previously, I mostly used vectors for their simplicity, but now I have more confidence to use other data structures that might be more efficient and be better suited for the type of data I'll be working with.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The work leading up to these projects have given me more practice and confidence in writing pseudocode. Project One also has given me a better ability to analyze program's runtime. Previously, I had no idea how to even begin to think about a program's efficiency. Project Two has given me practice in writing structs, separate functions, and writing understandable comments.
